ONE day back there in the good old days when I was nine and the
world was full of every imaginable kind of magnificence and life
was still a delightful and mysterious dream my cousin Mourad
who was considered crazy by everybody who knew him except
me came to my house at four in the morning and woke me up
tapping on the window of my room
Aram he said
I jumped out of bed and looked out of the window
I couldn’t believe what I saw
It wasn’t morning yet but it was summer and with daybreak
not many minutes around the corner of the world it was light
enough for me to know I wasn’t dreaming
My cousin Mourad was sitting on a beautiful white horse
I stuck my head out of the window and rubbed my eyes
Yes he said in Armenian It’s a horse You’re not dreaming
Make it quick if you want to ride horses the way my cousin Mourad and I were it wasn’t stealing
It wouldn’t become stealing until we offered to sell the horse
which of course I knew we would never do
Let me put on some clothes I said
All right he said but hurry
I leaped into my clothes
I jumped down to the yard from the window and leaped up
onto the horse behind my cousin Mourad
 That year we lived at the edge of town on Walnut Avenue
Behind our house was the country vineyards orchards
irrigation ditches and country roads In less than three minutes
we were on Olive Avenue and then the horse began to trot The
air was new and lovely to breathe The feel of the horse running
was wonderful My cousin Mourad who was considered one of
the craziest members of our family began to sing I mean he
began to roar
Every family has a crazy streak in it somewhere and my
cousin Mourad was considered the natural descendant of the
crazy streak in our tribe Before him was our uncle Khosrove
an enormous man with a powerful head of black hair and the
largest moustache in the San Joaquin Valley a man so furious
in temper so irritable so impatient that he stopped anyone from
talking by roaring It is no harm pay no attention to it
That was all no matter what anybody happened to be talking
about Once it was his own son Arak running eight blocks to
the barber’s shop where his father was having his moustache
trimmed to tell him their house was on fire This man Khosrove
sat up in the chair and roared It is no harm pay no attention to
it The barber said But the boy says your house is on fire So
Khosrove roared Enough it is no harm I say
My cousin Mourad was considered the natural descendant
of this man although Mourad’s father was Zorab who was
practical and nothing else That’s how it was in our tribe A
man could be the father of his son’s flesh but that did not
mean that he was also the father of his spirit The distribution
of the various kinds of spirit of our tribe had been from the
beginning capricious and vagrant
We rode and my cousin Mourad sang For all anybody knew
we were still in the old country where at least according to
some of our neighbours we belonged We let the horse run as
long as it felt like running
At last my cousin Mourad said Get down I want to ride
alone
Will you let me ride alone I asked
That is up to the horse my cousin said Get down
The horse will let me ride I said
We shall see he said Don’t forget that I have a way
with a horse
Well I said any way you have with a horse I have also
For the sake of your safety he said let us hope so Get down
All right I said but remember you’ve got to let me try to
ride alone
I got down and my cousin Mourad kicked his heels into the
horse and shouted Vazire run The horse stood on its hind
legs snorted and burst into a fury of speed that was the loveliest
