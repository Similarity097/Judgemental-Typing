As you can see, the title is "SWEAT". Someone must be 
definitely excited! to try this out, to see if they are the 
best one out there to ever attempt this level. I'll be 
checking this level regularly, to see if someone was able 
to beat it. I will! Me!. Once,twice,thrice, 4 times even 5 
times. I;d like to see you struggle just as ! did. It's 
very fun making these types of elaborate things because you 
can write whatever you want! And input commonly mispeled 
words! As you probably noticed by now, that mistake was on
purpose. Or was it?  we'll never know for sure; oR at least 
you won`t but I @s the one who-s typing thi$ do definitely 
know about it. Do your best! I will do my best.Believe in 
yourself.This thing is gonna repeat for hours. And hours. 
I'm just eating food while typing this thing up. You might 
as well do the same. Or not. Eitherways, may you not 
succumb to ths level and c;me out victorioys`. Take 
precaution y0u might as well end up w/ a headache*
