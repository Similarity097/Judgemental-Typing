# Judgemental-Typing
Type speed tester
PROJECT FOR GROUP AVENTADOR

Have you played a typing speed game? Itâ€™s a very useful game to track your typing speed and improve it with regular practice. In this semester, we have worked on Typing speed test. In this you can test your speed and accuracy with it.

In this we have used Pygame that is an Open-Source python programming language library for making multimedia applications like games, etc. We used modules such as os , time , random to create different parts of the application .
